Abstract
This project presents a comprehensive approach for mobile robot navigation in simulated environments, utilizing both MATLAB for object detection and classification, and CoppeliaSim with Lua for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and localization. The Pioneer P3DX robot is used as a test platform to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, which aims to enhance the robot's navigation capabilities in both static and dynamic environments. The proposed method combines image segmentation techniques, such as Edge Detection and Otsu thresholding in MATLAB, with advanced control algorithms in CoppeliaSim, including Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller algorithm for line following, Potential Field Algorithm for obstacle avoidance, and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) technique for localization. The goal is to develop a navigation system that can handle both static and dynamic environments.
